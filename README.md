These are projects that I made for ECE 4001 class. In each folder there will be a read me file with instructions on what to do.
I did accidentaly perminately delete the emotional recognition project and don't know how to get it back. It was my first time using git hub and It was a massive mistake. That is why the folder is basicly empty
